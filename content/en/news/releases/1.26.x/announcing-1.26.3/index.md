## Changes

- **Fixed** ambient index to filter configs by revision.
  ([Issue #56477](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477))

- **Fixed** ignoring the `topology.istio.io/network` label on the system namespace when `discoverySelectors` are in use.
  ([Issue #56687](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687))

- **Fixed** CNI incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod which has been deleted to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurs ztunnel will not be able to become ready.  ([Issue #56738](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738))

- **Fixed** an issue where access log not being updated when referenced service created later than the Telemetry resource.  ([Issue #56825](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825))

- **Fixed** issues that `ClusterTrustBundle` was not working when `ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API` is enabled.

- **Fixed** issue where Istio access logs are never sent to OTLP endpoint.  ([Issue 56825](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825))

- **Fixed** issue with `istiod` causing high CPU usage.  ([PR 56798](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/56798))

- **Added** test flag which allows the use of the `AllowCRDsMismatch` parameter defined in the Gateway API Conformance suite. ([PR #56945](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/56945))
