The Helm charts used in this guide are the same as those used when
installing Istio via [Istioctl](/pt-br/docs/setup/install/istioctl/), with the exception of the `gateway` chart.

Istioctl uses a different [gateway chart]({{< github_tree >}}/manifests/charts/gateways/istio-ingress) than the [gateway chart]({{< github_tree >}}/manifests/charts/gateway) described in this guide
